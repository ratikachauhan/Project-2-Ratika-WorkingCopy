Meet the team: Ratna Jadhav, Arnaz Alavi, Ratika Chauhan, Seong-Min Kim, Junaid Dawood 

Introduction: Our group found interesting data on Kaggle about Crime Incidents in Chicago. We researched other formats for the data (JSON, GeoJSON, CSV).

Timeline of Activities: 
October 19: Determined dataset and initial project management duties. 
October 21: Completed Project Proposal including the project timeline, separation of responsibility, creation of GitHub repo, and confirmation of technologies/programs we plan to use. 
October 23: Complete ETL section of the project. (Finishing full clean up, and load of data into the database so that it is ready for front-end development). Create initial visual (brainstorm) to work off of. 
Oct 24-Nov : Hold regular working sessions to complete visuals.

Graph 2: Arnaz
Graph 3: Junaid

In order to create an interactive visual to display the data we found, we will be completing the following processes:
1. To clean up data (ETL), we are using Pandas. 
2. We will be loading our data into the mongodb. The data will be loaded directly from Pandas. 
3. Build the front end schema of the visuals using HTML 
4. Plot a couple pie plots, bar graphs, bubble graphs, search of a districts/neighborhoods (by zip code), and a map of the data using D3 (mapping web). 
    * Create flask applications for each visual
    * Combine all flask applications to consolidate all visuals
